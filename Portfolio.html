 <h1>Portfolio</h1>
 
                   <p1> This are some things I have learned in my computer science class.</p1>

                   <p2> So one of the projects we have done is make an app on App Inventor.Ours is called Spanish Learner. In app
we were able to design and make it and make it work the way we want. Our final product was great. 
It wasnt perfect but itt was a good outcome in the end</p2>
 
                   <p3>This is Light Bot. In Light Bot in we basically learned how to piece together cade so that an action could be done. 
 There were3 levels, basic, procedures and loops, each getting harder as the levels passed.</p3>

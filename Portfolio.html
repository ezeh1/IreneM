<p1>So this is a portfolio of what I have done in my Comp-Science class.</p1>

<p2> So one of the projects we have done is make an app on App Inventor. Ours is called Spanish Learner.

With App Inventor, we were able to design it and make it work the way we wanted. Our final product worked great.

It wasn't perfect but it was a good outcome in the end.</p2>

<p3> This is Light Bot. In Light Bot we basically learned how to piece together code so that an action could be done.

There were 3 levels, basics, procedures and loops, each getting harder as the levels passed.

It was tricking at first on how to place the code so we could complete the level.</p3>

<p4> Khan Academy was a big help on building this website and the others I have done.

In Khan Academy, I was able to learn some basics of CSS and HTML.

It was difficult to get understand how we could use all of this but it did help me make this website.</p4>

<p5> Before learning the basics of HTML and CSS on Khan Academy, I learned how to code a game on One of Hour, also on Khan Academy.

With this activity, it really helped to understand the flow of how the code should work.

Every activity helped me in how to use the code correctly.</p5>

<p6> To create this website, we used a website to create it called Git Hub. In Git Hub, you have to code your website from scratch. 

HTML and CSS is what creates these websites.

The most difficult website to make out of all of them was this website, Portfolio, out of all.</p6>

<p7> We used a website called Scratch that is used to create games, apps, and much more with its own code.

One project we did on Scratch was to animate a figure to do whatever, from walking to jumping to playing a game as long as it worked. 

We did do another project that required to change an original game into a different one.</p7>

<p8> Before going on Git Hub to publish our websites, we used Notepad++ to start off our website. 

We started with making our website 'Index'. At first it was simple, it just had a heading saying 'This is easy and fun!'.

We then moved on to making 'Ice', but we had to make it have color by using CSS. Then we moved to Git Hub to start on our 'Home' page.</p8>
